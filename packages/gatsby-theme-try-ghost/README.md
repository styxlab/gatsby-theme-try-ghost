2. Add the following configuration to your `gatsby-config.js` file

    ```js
    // gatsby-config.js
    module.exports = {
    plugins: [
        {
        resolve: `gatsby-theme-try-ghost`,
        options: {
            siteConfig: {
                siteUrl: `https://your-bog.com`,
                postsPerPage: 3,
                siteTitleMeta: `Gatsby frontend powered by headless Ghost CMS`,
                siteDescriptionMeta: `Turn your Ghost blog into a flaring fast static site with Gatsby`, 
                shareImageWidth: 1000,
                shareImageHeight: 523,
                shortTitle: `Ghost`,
                siteIcon: `favicon.png`,
                backgroundColor: `#e9e9e9`,
                themeColor: `#15171A`,
                // Overwrite navigation menu (default: []), label is case sensitive
                // overwriteGhostNavigation: [{ label: `Home`, url: `/` }],
            },
            ghostConfig: {
                "development": {
                    "apiUrl": "https://your-ghost-cms.com",
                    "contentApiKey": "9fcfdb1e5ea5b472e2e5b92942",
                },
                "production": {
                    "apiUrl": "https://your-ghost-cms.com",
                    "contentApiKey": "9fcfdb1e5ea5b472e2e5b92942",
                },
            },
            //routes: {
            //    // Root url for Ghost posts and pages (optional, defaults to `/`)
            //    basePath: `/blog`,
            //
            //    // Collections (optional , default: [])
            //    collections: [{
            //        path: `speeches`,
            //        selector: node => node.primary_tag && node.primary_tag.slug === `speeches`,
            //    }],
            //},
          },
       },
    ],  
    }
    ```

3. Update siteConfig

    In the configuration shown above, the most important fields to be changed are `siteUrl`, `siteTitleMeta` and `siteDescriptionMeta`. Update at least those to fit your needs. Also make sure your `favicon.png` can be found in folder `static` of your working directory.

4. Ghost Content API Keys

    Change the `apiUrl` value to the URL of your Ghost CMS site. Next, update the `contentApiKey` value to a key associated with the Ghost CMS site. A key can be provided by creating an integration within Ghost Admin. Navigate to *Integrations* and click *Add new integration*. Give the integration a name and click create.

5. Advanced Routing

    You can define a `basePath` that is added to all routes, effectively moving all routes one level down. Collections are distinct groups of posts that get an entry point at `collections.path`. Permalinks are best configured in`routes.yaml` of the Ghost CMS.

## Running

Start the development server. You now have a Gatsby site pulling content from headless Ghost.

```bash
gatsby develop
```

## Ensure headless mode of Ghost CMS

For best SEO results it is strongly recommended to disable the default Ghost Handlebars theme front-end by selecting the *Make this site private* flag within your Ghost admin settings. This enables password protection in front of the Ghost install and sets `<meta name="robots" content="noindex" />` so your Gatsby front-end becomes the source of truth for SEO.
